# Vision
Vision is an inclusive video conferencing application assisting visually challenged individuals to bridge the gap between technology and visually impaired. The application is functionally tailored towards visually challenged users, comfortable for partially challenged users and aesthetically pleasing to normal users. Apart from the user-interface, the performance and ease of usability are to be taken into account.

# Abstract
Since the emergence of smartphones and other internet-enabled devices, there has been a drastic change in how we communicate with each other. The ease of access has subsequently made our life more comfortable, but for people with disabilities, digital exclusion is still a real issue. At present, about sixty-two million people in India are suffering from sight loss. Although an average user's likelihood of having access to the internet is higher than that of a visually challenged user, the gap is gradually narrowing. Statistics show about 65% of visually challenged consumers had access to a computer in 2012 which has increased to 78% by 2016. Whereas in the case of non-disabled users, it increased from 79% to 84%. Despite the 13% growth in visually challenged users who access computers in the 4-year tenure from 2012 to 2016, digital exclusion is far from being resolved. Thus, our main objective is to bridge this gap between technology and disabled people by creating an application that visually challenged people and general users can easily use.

# Problem Statement
Companies tend to focus on active users who tend to have greater purchasing power and a higher level of digital learning. Users with disabilities are often not the target consumers in this market-driven and technology-driven approach. We believe that the design should be in line with the users' needs rather than just focusing on beauty. Natural barriers in society commit the constraint of disabilities, so if we optate to avail visually impaired users to engage with the world around them, digital care is essential. The utilization of digital devices does not match the caliber of interest in digital technology. The ownership of digital gadgets for disabled users is comparatively low, and the national average inhibits their online activities.

# Project Objectives
•	The main objective of this application is to bridge the gap between the sighted users and the visually challenged users by developing the application in such a manner that both types of users can easily use it. 
•	The application will support video conferencing as well as the users can communicate with each other via texting.
•	The application should have the Speech to text feature to make it easy for visually challenged people to input in the application.
•	The application should have features like recording the meeting, securing the session using a password, toggle camera, raise hand system, inviting participants, and other features which can help the users during a video conference.
