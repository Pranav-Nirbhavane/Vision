# Vision
Vision is an inclusive video conferencing application assisting visually challenged individuals to bridge the gap between technology and visually impaired. The application is functionally tailored towards visually challenged users, comfortable for partially challenged users and aesthetically pleasing to normal users. Apart from the user-interface, the performance and ease of usability are to be taken into account.
